<p><a href="https://warhammer40000.com/"target="_blank" title="warhammer40000">Warhammer 40,000</a> is a <strong><u>miniature wargame</u> produced by Games Workshop</strong>. It is the most popular miniature wargame in the world, especially in the United Kingdom. The first edition of the rulebook was published in September 1987, and the ninth and current edition was released in July 2020.

<p style="margin-top:40px;">As in other miniature wargames, players enact battles using miniature models of warriors and fighting vehicles. The playing area is a tabletop model of a battlefield, comprising models of buildings, hills, trees, and other terrain features. Each player takes turns to move their model warriors around the battlefield and pretend that they are fighting their opponent's warriors. These imaginary fights are resolved using dice and simple arithmetic.
